## Content

### The ethical agency of AI developers

* Interviewed 40 candidates in the realm of AI/ML/DS
* Developers are mostly guided by technical values:
    * "Can we do this ?" rather than "Should we do this?"
* While the tool can be as morally evil as the user, there is also the matter of ignorance, as an ignorant user can use the tool in a bad way (because of lack of expertise)
* Ethics should be a bigger part of the developing cycle (Starting from education)
* "There is no bias in data" - One of the interviewed persons
    * Do you think there is a bias in data ?

### About Ethics

* What ethics is not: A set of laws
* Ethics summerized: Consider all the agents involved in your action
* Utilitarism has a great reasoning in ethics. Other motivations should be well argumented

### Translating Values into Design Requirements

* We start from abstract values and create concrete requirements (numeric) for them
* Hierarhically values are at the top, and requirements are more at the bottom
    * Ordered as: Values -> Norms -> Design Requirements


### Virtue Ethics, Technology, and Human Flourishing

* Virtue: excellence, right conduct, character, etc...
* Virtue Ethics has rules, but are not strict (The person should know when to apply them)
* Should there be an ethic that deals with technological advancement, or is that part of the specialized ethics that deal with certain domains like medicine ?

### INTRODUCTION: TECHNOLOGY AND ETHICS

* Is morally wrong to play video games all day ?
    * What if we assume a society where workforce is not needed ?
* Advancement in technology should lead to a better life for everyone (Discussion)
* Common concerns about technologies:
    * Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS)
    * Justice, access, and equality
    * Individual rights and liberties
    * Autonomy, authenticity, and identity
    * Dual Use (Possibility of unintended actions / ignorance)
* Technology advances faster than regulation, so the developer should take that into account
* Framework for ethical analysis of tech
    * Identify benefits
    * Identify existing concerns
    * Conduct a power analysis (Who benefits from this)
    * Conduct a form of life analysis (How it modifies the life)
    * Indentify intrinsec concerns
    * Identify easier solutions (Less tech sophisticated)
